      Last week I was at the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQqjELPcOU">Programming Local First 2022</a> workshop and the
      Ink and Switch Unconference in Berlin, and an interesting topic we talked about is how software keeps
      becoming obsolete. Part of this is <a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths">site deaths</a>. Another
      part is old software that no longer comes out on newer operating systems, or new software that no longer
      comes out for older operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, progress is good, but there are three major potential problems when software updates or gets
      replaced by a newer thing:
      <ul>
        <li>Users need to adapt to the interface of the new system</li>
        <li>Data needs to adapt to the interface of the new system</li>
        <li>Neighbouring systems need to adapt to the interface of the new system</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Neighbouring systems can be polyglot (<a href="./26.html">CLOGS</a>-aware), and data can be translated on-the-fly. But users
      may just prefer to keep using the user interface they are familiar with. And this may be possible through CLOGS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose two companies merge, and their ERP systems need to merge too. This can be achieved through an expensive
      data migration, or with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management">Master Data Management</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_virtualization">Data Virtualisation</a>, the systems
      can run side-by-side. If data is not migrated away from the format it was in, then software can maybe also be kept
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow software to keep running despite switching dependencies, it would be good to package the software in a way
      that includes all its dependencies, all the way down to the operating system. Docker is a useful tool that helps
      with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a software system will depend on a connection with a neighbouring system that gets shut down, but
      if that neighbouring system also adheres to CLOGS, then the old API can be kept operational.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major headache could be security updates; it may not always be possible to maintain an API if for instance
      its authentication protocol is outdated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem would be the build-up of complexity if old database tables need to be kept around for
      backwards compatibility. It's basically the burden of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system#Problems_posed_by_legacy_computing">Legacy Code</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end I think maybe this problem is fundamentally unsolvable: software just gets deprecated and it's a pity but that's it.
