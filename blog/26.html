<h2>Solid and Inrupt: a merge request</h2>
<p>With their <a href="https://inrupt.com/blog/V1.1-Release">latest blogpost</a>,
  Inrupt have announced a number of new features in their enterprise Solidserver.
We can expect the Inrupt-funded community edition to implement these same features.
So what does that mean for the other Solid server implementations and for Solid app
developers?</p>
<h3>Admin apps and user apps</h3>
<p>Each Solid pod server implementation is expected to have some features that
  add value beyond just being a spec-compliant server that passes the independent
  Solid test suite. And because of this, each server is likely to have a little bit
  of server-specific eco-system around it. A good example of this is admin apps: they
  can be used by a Solid user to configure which other apps and users have access to
  their pod. Of course, we want to standardise how admin apps work, because we want
  to standardise everything. But at least the incompatibilities between access management
  protocols like <a href="">WAC</a> and <a href="">ACP</a> are only limiting a Solid user
  in their choice of admin app.</p>
  <p>What is more important is to standardise the interaction between user apps (i.e.
    all Solid apps that are not admin apps), identity providers, and pod servers.
  In this blogpost we will only consider the impact of spec changes on app developers.
  
  <h3>Announcing and Distributing your Solid app</h3>
  <p>When you have built a Solid app, you will want to add it to the Solid-Nextcloud 
    launcher, host it on a dedicated FQDN so that it can be referred to by its origin
    in WAC, and since last week, also give it an app-webid so that it can be referred
    to in ACP.
  
  <h3>User login</h3>
  <p>When a user logs into your app with their web browser, they will do a redirect
    dance to the identity provider and back. The exact details of this dance can affect
    the user experience of your app. In general, it's best to use either solid-auth-fetcher 
    or
